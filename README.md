## Firmware
Upgrading your L16 Camera to version 1.3.5.1 is to be done at your own risk.  
This firmware was produced by Light who no longer support the Light L16 Camera.  
I, nor anyone who contributes to this repository accept any responsibility for any damage to your device.  
  
I suggest having at least half charge in your device before starting the upgrade.  
If you have any issues, you can enter the devices boot menu by holding the shutter button when powering up your device, from there you can wipe data.  

> :warning: **Remove Root before starting upgrade**: Root can cause a soft brick when applying the upgrade. Thanks [matthew___h](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/light-l16-firmware.4403267/post-87944333/)
